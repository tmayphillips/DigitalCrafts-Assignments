  <p class="main_content">Ankylosaurus was the largest-known ankylosaurine dinosaur and possibly the largest ankylosaurid. In 2004 the American paleontologist Kenneth Carpenter estimated that the individual with the largest-known skull (specimen CMN 8880), which is 64.5 cm (25.4 in) long and 74.5 cm (29.3 in) wide, was about 6.25 m (20.5 ft) long and had a hip height of about 1.7 m (5 ft 7 in). The smallest-known skull (specimen AMNH 5214) is 55.5 cm (21.9 in) long and 64.5 cm (25.4 in) wide, and Carpenter estimated that it measured about 5.4 m (17.7 feet) long and about 1.4 m (4 ft 7 in) tall at the hips. In 2017, based on comparisons with more complete ankylosaurines, the Canadian paleontologists Victoria Arbour and Jordan Mallon estimated a length of 7.56–9.99 m (24.8–32.8 ft) for CMN 8880 and 6.02–7.95 m (19.8–26.1 ft) for AMNH 5214. Though the latter is the smallest specimen of Ankylosaurus, its skull is still larger than those of any other ankylosaurins. A few other ankylosaurs reached about 6 m (20 feet) in length. Because the vertebrae of AMNH 5214 are not significantly larger than those of other ankylosaurines, Arbour and Mallon considered their upper range estimate of nearly 10 m (33 feet) for large Ankylosaurus too long, and suggested a length of 8 m (26 ft) instead. Arbour and Mallon estimated a weight of 4.78 tonnes (4.70 long tons) for AMNH 5214 and tentatively estimated the weight of CMN 8880 at 7.95 tonnes (7.82 long tons). Benson and colleagues also estimated the weight for the animal of AMNH 5214 at 4.78 tonnes (5.27 short tons) in 2014.</p>

  <p class="main_content">The structure of much of the skeleton of Ankylosaurus, including most of the pelvis, tail, and feet, is still unknown. It was quadrupedal, and its hind limbs were longer than its forelimbs. In specimen AMNH 5895, the scapula (shoulder blade) measures 61.5 cm (24.2 in) long and was fused with the coracoid (a rectangular bone connected to the lower end of the scapula). It also had entheses (connective tissue) for various muscle attachments. The humerus (upper arm bone) of AMNH 5214 was short, very broad and about 54 cm (21 in) long. The femur (thigh bone), also from AMNH 5214, was 67 cm (26 in) long and very robust. While the feet of Ankylosaurus are incompletely known, the hindfeet probably had three toes, as is the case in advanced ankylosaurids.</p>

  <p class="main_content">The cervical vertebrae of the neck had broad neural spines that increased in height towards the body. The front part of the neural spines had well-developed entheses, which was common among adult dinosaurs, and indicates the presence of large ligaments, which helped support the massive head. The dorsal vertebrae of the back had centra (or bodies) that were short relative to their width, and their neural spines were short and narrow. The dorsal vertebrae were tightly spaced, which limited the downwards movement of the back. The neural spines had ossified (turned to bone) tendons, which also overlapped some of the vertebrae. The ribs of the last four back vertebrae were fused to them, and the ribcage was very broad in this part of the body. The ribs had scars that show where muscles attached to them. The caudal vertebrae of the tail had centra that were slightly amphicoelous, meaning they were concave on both sides.</p>
